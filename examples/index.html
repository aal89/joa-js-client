        //hereafter follows aan example implementation of a JOA object
        //i also try to be as explanatory as possible, however no new information
        //will be given in this example as all explanations found here is from the
        //documentation
        
        //first we initialise the object with the url of the backoffice
        JOA("https://joa3.munisense.net/debug/");
        //then let the JOA object know we are submitting our data to the debugging end of
        //the backoffice instead of the production end of the backoffice, this is not a
        //flag to be used for debugging the JOA object. Default is false.
        JOA.debug = true;
        
        //now we set the headers for this JOA object, they will be used when parsing a valid
        //JOA3 header definition, we can define our JOA headers in two ways:
        
        //EXAMPLE 1; set/get individual headers:
        //JOA.header.gatewayIdentifier = "10.32.16.1";
        //JOA.header.attribute.time = true;
        //JOA.header.attribute.hash = true;
        //JOA.header.attribute.secret = "waiga6ieGo4eefo2thaQuash4ahc4aid";
        //JOA.header.attribute.vendor = "androidnode";
        
        //EXAMPLE 2; set JOA headers in one go using an object:
        JOA.headers({
            attribute: {
                vendor: "androidnode",
                time: true,
                hash: true,
                secret: "waiga6ieGo4eefo2thaQuash4ahc4aid"
            },
            gatewayIdentifier: "10.32.16.1"
        });
        
        //next we add our desired reports:
        //this report is not valid for the backoffice
        JOA.addZCLReport("", "", "", "", "", "", "", "80" );
        //the following are valid:
        JOA.addZCLReport("f104:00ff:0000:0001", null, null, "0x0402", "0x0000", "0x20", 1474552384381, "1");
        JOA.addZCLReport("", null, null, "", "", "", 0, "12");
        JOA.addZCLReport("i", "do", "tests", "every", "day", "yeah", "", "a");
        //to save some bits in transport we could also create a report with empty values,
        //the backoffice will reconstruct a complete message based on the previous one
        //(in this case based on the message f104:00ff:0000:0002)
        //NOTE: addZCLReport() will only parse syntactically valid JOA3 messages and cant check
        //if it is contextually valid, meaning that when this message is the first or only one to
        //be send, the backoffice wont be able to reconstruct this message and will reply back
        //with a 485 error code
        JOA.addZCLReport("f104:00ff:0000:000f", "", "", "", "", "", "", "");
        //maybe add some different types of reports.
        //a multireport is just a bunch of single ZCL reports combined.

        //before we post any results we could see the complete payload with the toString() method
        //or we could get the hash of the payload by using the toHash() method

        //the reponse comes through a callback, if err is not set we're good
        //the result will have the result set returned from the server in
        //the same format as described in the JOA3 specifications document.
        //A final messages parameter is given to check your results with your
        //sent messages, be aware; after this call (iff it was a successful
